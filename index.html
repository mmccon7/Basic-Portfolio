		<h2>About Me</h2>
		
			<p><img id="profilepic" src="assets/images/profilepic.jpg" alt="Profile Pic"> I am an Arizona native of 20 plus years and enjoy living in the desert with my wife and 3 beautiful children.  I currently work as a Salesman/IT Help Desk at a building supply company and spend my days checking website sales and taking phone orders. <br><br>
			I became interested in coding and website creation shortly after college when I discovered that I could easily create an online presence for my business from popular website creation sites such as WIX or Squarespace.  For many of the website creation sites I couldnt achieve the exact look or structure that I was looking for.  This led me to join a coding bootcamp from the University of Arizona and began a career transition into web development. Best decision ever!!!

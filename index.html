      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="assets/images/profilepic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Matthew McConaghie">
      <p>I am an Arizona native of 20 plus years and enjoy living in the desert with my wife and 3 beautiful children.  I currently work as a Salesman/IT Help Desk at a building supply company and spend my days checking website sales and taking phone orders.</p>
      <p>I became interested in coding and website creation shortly after college when I discovered that I could easily create an online presence for my business from popular website creation sites such as WIX or Squarespace.  For many of the website creation sites I couldnt achieve the exact look or structure that I was looking for.  This led me to join a coding bootcamp from the University of Arizona and began a career transition into web development. Best decision ever!!!</p>
